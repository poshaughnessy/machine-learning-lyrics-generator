Ice baby, I saw your girlfriend and she's eating her fingers like they're just another meal
But she waits there in the levee washes mixing cocktails with a plastic-tipped cigar
My eyes stick to all the shiny robes you wear on the protein delta strip in an abandoned house
But I will wait there, I'll be waiting forever
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Minerals, ice deposit daily
Drop off the first shiny robe
I've got a lot of things I want to sell, but not here, babe, Tokyo
Every time I sit around, I find I'm shot
Every time I turn around, my friend, every time I sit around, my friend
Every time, every time, every time, every time, every time, every time,
You're my summer babe
Summer babe
Lies and betrayals, fruit-covered nails
Electricity and lust won't break the door
I've got a heavy coat, it's filled with rocks and sand
And if I lose it I'll be coming back today, I've got a message for you
I'll be coming back today, I keep it in my hand
You know I'm coming back one day, I've got a system for two
And I'll be coming back today
Ex-magician that still knows the tricks
Tricks are everything to me until it's free
I've got a trigger cut and I can't pull it back
But if I learn how I'll be coming back today, I've got a message for you
You know I'm coming back today, I keep it in my hand
And you will look at me and say, I've got a system for two
That you just wish I went away
I learned the truth, the truth of the words
Truth I made for you because it's just as good
And if I spit it out before I chew the ring
I'll rearrange it 'til it looks just like today, I've got a message for you
And I'll be coming back my way, I keep it in my hand
Then you will look at me and say, I've got a system for two
That you just wish I went away today 
Take me down from the ridge where the summer ends
And watch the city spread out just like a jet's flame
I've got a secret for you, I cut your angel in two
I left her bleeding and soaked it with a dry sponge
No life has singed her now
I can see it fade
We've got a license to live, it's our only one
If it expires we float up to the dust haze
I've got a picture of you, I cut your angel in two
I saw her spinning and dripping on your new dress
Can you treat it like an oil well
When it's underground, out of sight?
And if the site is just a whore-sign
Can it make enough sense to me?
Pretend the table is a trust-knot
We'll put our labels down, favors down
I'll watch a yarn of twine unravel
And you'll never get it back
It's what I want (it's what I want)
It's what I want (twine comes down)
It's what I want (it's what I want)
Don't you know
I could make a try
Make a try make a try make a try
I've been crowned the King of Id
And Id is all we have, so wait
To hear my words
And they're diamond-sharp
I could open it up
And it's up and down
It's what (it's what I want)
I'll see you beg like a little dog (ball and twine)
Don't you know that
It's what I want? (it's what I want)
I'll see you beg and it makes you dry
Make me dry make me dry make me dry
I've been down, the King of Id's
Id's all we have, I've been down
And I could wait
To hear the words
They're diamond-sharp today
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin' and I'll try
Imagine if you were Herr Barockter, alias and nobleman, son of son of sky, and of scion
Part of his rich inheritance parceled and generous divorce, sentence forthwith being
Certain blocks of land and living quarters deemed by all gentlemen and wives thereof
To be grossly humane and frankly, quite undirty
Herr Barockter, in his enviable good taste, tries quick escape gambit via local periodicals
But no takers land an enviable station in the conduit between two selves
A veritable no-man's-land, array of the flophouse cardboard materials and carbon-monoxide wallpaper
All his brig-deck Torino boys ask is irrelevant
Unable to bear the scandal, Ray, philanthropist, rents low-down scab house in conduit
Herr Barockter offers said land for a song, but no one wants to sing
In an attempt to retain social privileges, yet mask it as goodwill, he says to the conduit members,
"Take this rotten old tree and make it bear fruit."
Cheers erupted throughout the thin settlement; an Italian male was heard to say,
"Between here and there is better than either here or there!"
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
I can't sing it strong enough
'Cause that kind of strength I just don't have
If you watch the lights change, please
Don't hold them hanging
You think it's easy, but you're wrong
I am not one half of the problem
Zürich is stained and it's not my fault
Just hold me back or let me run
So what does it mean, a mistake or two?
If it's the kind of mistakes no one can trace
To the fountain where we sold it
And held them hanging
You think it's easy, but you're wrong
I am not one half of the problem
Zürich is stained and it's not my fault
Just hold me back or let me run
You think it's easy, but you're wrong
I am not one half of the problem
Zürich is stained and it's not my fault
Just hold me back or let me run 
I'm bogged, I'm bogged down
I am bogged down
How can I, how can I, how can I
Make my body shed for you?
How can I, how can I, how can I
Make my body shed around your metal scars?
Loretta's scars Loretta's scars Loretta's scars 
From now on I can see the sun
Makes me anxious, makes me run
From now on I can see the sun
Makes me nervous, makes me run
How can I, how can I, how can I
Make my body shed for you?
How can I, how can I, how can I
Make my body shed around your metal scars?
I was dressed for success, but success it never comes
And I'm the only one who laughs at your jokes when they are so bad
And your jokes are always bad
But they're not as bad as this
Come join us in a prayer
We'll be waiting, waiting where
Everything's ending here
And all the sterile striking, it defends an empty dock you cast away
And rain upon the forehead where the mist's for hire if it's just too clear
Let's spend our last quarterstance randomly
Go down to the outlet once again
Painted portraits of minions and slaves, crotch mavens and one-night plays
Are they the only ones who laugh at the jokes when they are so bad?
And the jokes, they're always bad
But they're not as bad as this
Come join us in a prayer
We'll be waiting, waiting where
Everything's ending here
And all the Spanish candles unsold away have gone to this
And a run-on piece of mountain trembles, shivers, runs down the freeway
I guess she spent her last quarter randomly
I guess a guess is the best I'll do
Last time Last time
Was the best time I spent
Two states
We want two states
North and south
Two, two states
Forty million daggers Forty million daggers Forty million daggers Forty million daggers
Two states
We want two states
There's no culture
There's no spies
Fun for an hour, when the hour's gone
Can one trick nights feed forty days?
In my bed at the break of dawn
She shivered like a vein slashed bright and new
She's got the radio active and it makes me feel okay
I don't feel okay
She's got the radio active and it makes me feel okay
I don't feel okay
Grip-force the vials and strip the locks
Smash the set and slash the beds
And when it looks like a wife's ex-plot
We'll cover all the rugs with cheap perfume
She's got the radio active and it makes me feel okay
I don't feel okay
She's got the radio active and it makes me feel okay
Like a docent's lisp, like a damsel's spit
Like a dry gin's twist of lime
Like a poor droll sir, like a pike's dull spurs
Like a pastor's flock of sheep 
Fame throwa pass out the gold, the diamond watch, the last reward
All the things we had before you sold us out and took it all
Head-borne cries from zenith sluts, astral rites from dead-end ruts
And these ends are sickened wars, and the ends were sickened wars
He's one of our nation's spies
He's one of our first recruits
I click with her leather thighs
He's one of our first recruits
How can you know? In the distance lies a grower
Named Rudolph, king fame throwa, son of groupie, bedworn sexan
Spent his cash convincing us that the desert was a starscape
Took our lives for satellites so we could cry, naked, naked, foul
He's one of our nation's spies
He's one of our first recruits
I click with her leather thighs
He's one of our first recruits
I've got one holy life to live
I've got one holy life to give
I've been waiting, anticipating
The sun comes up, the skies won't sink my soul
I've dreamt of this but it never comes, but it never comes
The rising, the nature's dry folk
I've been dreaming, traced out, but dreaming
The sun comes up, the blisters burn my soul
I'm dreaming of something now, of something now
Of the rising, the nature's dry, and all the groovy ones 
Silent kid, no one to remind you
You've got no hip, no reels to remind you
Silent kid, don't take your pawnshop home on the road, goddamn you
Silent kid, don't lose your graceful tone
This is the city life
This is the city life
Oh come on, let's talk about leaving
Come on now, talk about your family
Your sister's cursed, your father's all but damned you
Silent kid, don't listen to your grandmother's advice about Ezra
Silent kid, don't listen to them
Hand me the drumstick, snare kick, blues call upon I knew myself in
Into the spotlight, ecstasy feels so warm inside
Until five hours later, I'm chewing
Screwing myself with my hand
Well you greet the tokens and stamps
Underneath the fake oil-burning lamps
In the city we forgot to name
The concourse is a four-wheeled shame
And the courthouse's double-breast
I'd like to check out your public protests
Why you're complaining, ta
Those who sleep with electric guitars
Range roving with the cinema stars
And I wouldn't want to shake their hands
'Cause they're in such a high-protein land
Because there's forty different shades of black
So many fortresses and ways to attack
So why you complaining, ta?
Got struck by the first volley of the war in the courts
Never held my service
Send 'em a wire, give 'em my best, this ammunition never rests
No one serves coffee, no one wakes up
Stop breathin, stop breathin
Breathin for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me, dad, they broke me
Stop breathin, stop breathin
Breathin for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me, dad, they broke me
I can see the lines, open shutters, and the leaves flocked on a grid
That's what they made my hero say
But nothing gets me off so completely than when you put it down ten feet down in the ground
Call and response, negative hope
Stop breathin, stop breathin
Breathin for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me, dad, they broke me
Stop breathin, stop breathin
Breathin for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me, dad, they broke me
Darling don't you go and cut your hair
Do you think it's gonna make him change?
I'm just a boy with a new haircut
And that's a pretty nice haircut
Charge it like a puzzle, hitmen wearing muzzles
Hesitate, you die
Look around, around, the second drummer drowned
His telephone is found
Music scene's crazy
Bands start up each and every day
I saw another one just the other day
A special new band
I remember lying, I don't remember a line
I don't remember a word but I don't care
I care, I really don't care
Did you see the drummer's hair?
Advertising looks and chops a must, no big hair!
Songs mean a lot when songs are bought and so are you
Bitch right down to the practice room
Attention and fame, a career, career, career, career
Lane driver, the forces against you, the rain
I know everybody wants to put you down
But I know everybody's gonna put me down
I want you
Because I'm rushing to feel you
But I won't set you down, I don't need to
Because I'm rushing to feel you
But I won't set you down, I don't need to
Fly fly fly fly fly fly fly
Don't try try try try try
It's a brand new era, it feels great
It's a brand new era but it came too late
She won't let you know that I need a right to touch her
She won't let you wait for me, for me to touch you
Crowds of the people and voices and steeples and wedding rings
Wild are the horses and break-up divorces and separate rooms from
My my my my my my my
I love your tinted eyes
So bad, so bad, so so bad so so bad
She won't let me break you out
When the picture's cut it free
Three of us is enough, it's the simple stuff I need
Can't you see the stuff I need?
Can't you see?
Can't you stuff me?
Stuff me
Down in Santa Rosa and over the bay
Across the grapevine to LA
We've got desert, we've got trees
We've got the hills of Beverly
Let's burn the hills of Beverly!
Walk with your credit card in the air
Swing it nine times like you just don't care
This is the slow, sick, sucking part of me
And when I suck in kisses, it's ours
Up to the top of the Shasta Gulch
To the bottom of the Tahoe Lake
Man-made deltas and concrete rivers
The south takes what the north delivers
You film hack, I don't use your fade
Lost in the foothills of my pride
Trocadero, say goodnight
To the last psychadelic band
From Sacto, Northern Cal
From Sacto, Northern Cal
Take it neighbor, 'cause you're my neighbor
And I need favors, you're my neighbor
You've done me favors 'cause I'm your neighbor
I'm not your neighbor, you Bakersfield trash
Go back to those gold soundz and keep my anthem to yourself
Because it's nothing I don't like, is it a crisis or a boring change?
When it's central, so essential, it has a nice ring when you laugh
At the lowlife opinions, and they're coming to the chorus now
I keep my address to yourself
'Cause we need secrets
We need secret cret cret cret crets
Back right now
Because I never wanna make you feel that you're social
Never ignored soul, believe in what you wanna do
And do you think that it's a major flaw when they rise up in the falling rain
And if you stay around with your knuckles ground down, the trial's over, weapon's found
Keep my address to myself
Because it's secret
'Cause it's secret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret
Back right now
So drunk in the August sun and you're the kind of girl I like
Because you're empty and I'm empty and you can never quarantine the past
Did you remember in December that I won't need you when I'm gone?
And if I go there, I won't stay there because I'm sitting here too long
I've been sitting here too long
And I've been wasted
Advocating that word for the last word
Last words come up, all you've got to waste
Five minus four equals unity
Yeah baby oooh
With impunity
Impunity
A bottle of red
A bottle of white
I'll take my chances
Show me how sweet romance is
UNITY! YEAH!
After the glow, the scene, the stage
The sad talk becomes slow but there's one thing I'll never forget
Hey, you gotta pay your dues before you pay the rent
Over the turnstiles and out in the traffic
There's ways of living, it's the way I'm living, right or wrong
It's all that I can do and I wouldn't want to let you be
I want a range life if I could settle down
If I could settle down then I would settle down
Run from the pigs, the fuzz, the cops, the heat
Pass me your gloves, this crime it is never complete
Until you snort it up or shoot it down, you're never going to feel free
Out on my skateboard the night is just humming
And the gum smacks are the pulse I'll follow if my walkman fades
Well, I got absolutely no one, no one but myself to blame
Don't worry, we're in no hurry, school's out, what did you expect?
Out on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins
Nature kids, I, they don't have no function
I don't understand what they mean and I could really give a fuck
Stone Temple Pilots, they're elegant bachelors
They're foxy to me, are they foxy to you?
I will agree they deserve absolutely nothing, nothing more than me
Dreaming, dream, dream, dream, dream
Heaven is a truck
It got stuck
On the breeze
Asked the driver nicely,
I need a lift?
I need release.
The sand in the boats,
On the rose-covered floats
She is the queen of a canceled Pasadena thrill
I know arks can't fly
I know the sharks, they don't have wings
But lady you need some cold advice
About a few things
Loosen my dress
Tie me up just like all the rest
She is the queen of a canceled Pasadena, thrill
I'm up on a hill top where I
Keep you in sight, my little toys
I buried you because the sun
Will melt them
Got you up my sleeve
Hit the plane down
Taking over
Taking over your life
I'm taking over your scene
Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya
I would hope see the face I would hope you see her face
Hit the plane down (taking over)
There's no survivors
Don't even snow (we're not that disturbed)
Don't even snow
I'm taking over the scene
I'm taking everything
All I wanted it all
My little trick
I wouldn't mind just a milligram up my sleeve
I've got you up my sleeve
I've got to melt it
Hit the plane down there's no survivors
Hey lady, what do you need?
Do you think you'd like to come and bleed with me?
I'd like to invite you to a taste of my chalice
It's a special one, it's made of gold
Passed out on your couch, you left me there, thank you
Let me sleep it off, I need to sleep it off
I need to sleep, why don't you let me?
I need to sleep, why don't you?
I need to sleep, I need to sleep
I need to sleep, I need to sleep, why won't you let me?
I need to sleep, I need to sleep, why won't you, why won't you let me sleep?
The jam kids on their vespas and the glum looks on their faces
The street is full of punks, they got spikes
See those rockers with their long, curly locks, goodnight to the rock and roll era
'Cause they don't need you anymore, little girl, boy, girl, boy
Their composures are so distracted, Jasper's skinny arms
And the dance faction, a little too loose for me
Every night it's straight and narrow, laws are broken, amusing era
Round and round and round she goes
Pull out their plugs and they snort up their drugs
When they pull out their plugs and they snort up their drugs
Their throats are filled with
Pigs, they tend to wiggle when they walk
The infrastructure rots
And the owners hate the jocks with their agents and their dates
If the signatures are checked, you'll just have to wait
And we're counting up the instants that we save
Tired nation so depraved, from the cheap seats see us
Wave to the camera, it took a giant ramrod
To raze the demon settlement
But high-ho silver, ride
High-ho silver, ride
Take another ride to see me home
Listen to me, I'm on the stereo, stereo
My baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Gave me malaria, hysteria
What about the voice of Geddy Lee, how did it get so high?
I wonder if he speaks like an ordinary guy
I know him, and he does
Then you're my fact-checking cuz
Well, focus on the quasar in the mist
The kaiser has a cyst and I'm a blank want
List the qualms you have and if they stick
They will drown you in a crick
In the neck of a woods that was populated by
Tired nation on the fly
Everybody knows advice that was given out for free
Lots of details to discern, lots of details
But high-ho silver, ride
High-ho silver, ride
Takes another ride to make me
Oh, get off the air, I'm on the stereo, stereo
Blind date with the chancer, we had oysters and dry lancers
And the check, when it arrived, we went dutch, dutch, dutch, dutch
A redder shade of neck on a whiter shade of trash
And this emery board is giving me a rash
I'm flat out
You're so beautiful to look at when you cry
Freeze, don't move
You've been chosen as an extra in the movie adaptation of the sequel to your life
A shady lane, everybody wants one, a shady lane, everybody needs one
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh your god, oh his god, oh her god
It's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god
The worlds collide, but all that we want is a shady lane
Glance, don't stare
Soon you're being told to recognize your heirs
No, not me
I'm an island of such great complexity
Distress surrounds
In the muddy peaceful center of this town
Tell me off
In the hotel lobby right in front of all the bellboys and the over-friendly concierge
A shady lane, everybody wants one, a shady lane, everybody needs one
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh your god, oh his god, oh her god
It's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god
The worlds collide, but all that I want is a shady lane
You better find your way out, you better learn how to run
You better walk away and leave the angles for the shills
Well, I've been thinking for days about the means and the ways
That I could hate all I touch, I know you're my lady
But I could trickle, I could flood
A voice coach taught me to sing, he couldn't teach me to love
All the above
Easy talking, border blocking, transport is arranged
Praise the grammar police, set me up with your niece
Walk to Baltimore and keep the language off the street
Well, I'm of several minds, I am the worst of my kind
I want to cremate the crutch, I know you're my lady
But phone calls could corrupt the morning
I heed the surgeon's warning
Pillars of eights
I swung my fiery sword
I vent my spleen at the lord
He is abstract and bored
Too much milk and honey
Well, I'll waltz through the wilderness
With nothing but a compass and a canteen
Setting the scenes
Easy walking, border blocking, transport is arranged
The actress is always breaking things
The things you made she took you for
And I'm so tired I'd be lying
I hope the prarie buys you more
The fitness coast is growing near
The shores they don't stay blond this year
That's why the marblelawn stays clear and warm in time
I want to stay but my time is wasting
Magic lands call my name
They want to fire a missle launcher to the sky
I know I need to stay
And we all know that by staying here
It will be a good high this year
So what's the use of staying there
If you've got no use for time
The fitness coast is growing near
The shores they don't stay blond all year
The continent moves with growing fear
It's all for expensive lawn
I want to stay but my time is wasting
Magic lands call my name
They want to fire a missle launcher to the sky
I know I need to stay
I know I need to stay and fight the day
Embrace the senile genius
Watch him reinvent the wheel
I don't need your summary acts, summary acts
To give into the narrative age
Old to begin
I will set you back, set you back, set you
We got to feeling like a fixture
Set in 1966
Time came that we drifted apart, drifted apart
To find an identical twin
Searching for latent cause, blame it on menopause
Or perhaps stress and strain, credit cards, lumbar pain
But I've seen your double dares, everything extraordinaire
I know the things you do are gonna come back
Sherri, you smell different
Get up early in the bed, for you morning comes so easy
Spells have been cast and the urge has been lost
Snipers posted bills, as they should, of our midnight vacation
Back on the planet now
I'm beginning to see just how
Echelon your dreams and they'll come true
Type slowly
One of us is a cigar stand
And one of us is a lovely blue incandescent guillotine
The edge of creation is blurred and blushed
Not a lot of room to grow inside this leather terrarium
People of the bay
It is excruciatingly gray
Face the front when he comes for you
Type slowly
Cherish your memorized weakness
Fashioned from a manifesto
Lady, I am no futurist
I'm my only critic, I
Trolls in the glen are consorting again
The liberals say they don't exist, but I know that they do
Reinforce your literal ass
Hit it on the first or second pass
Frozen images, respected few
Type slowly
Old intuition, on your dock we're fishing
Come on now, give us a grade
A for effort and a B for delivery
C for devotion when the world starts encroaching on your plans
Where is the savoir, where is the savoir?
He's not here right now
Where is the savoir?
Where is the savoir-faire?
Embassy row, the fumes they lay low
On lanes that are wide, where the limousines glide
On the wrought-iron gates and the bone china plates
And don't forget your manners where the anthems play
In a netherworld of foreign feeds, in a netherworld of foreign feeds
In a netherworld of foreign feeds
I'm gonna take the crown, I'm gonna take the crown
Maids, they are frisked and asses are kissed
I needed a visa, I bought off a geezer
Political favors could make you a savior
In an open corner where the news is late
In a netherworld of foreign feeds, in a netherworld of foreign feeds
In a netherworld of foreign feeds
I'm gonna take the crown, I'm gonna take the crown
I'm gonna take a crown, I'm gonna take a crown
I need to get born, I need to get dead
I'm sick of the forms, I'm sick of being misread
By men in dashikis and their leftist weeklies
Colonized wrath, their shining new path
The converted castle of moorish design
If you want to stay the weekend, well, we wouldn't mind
The plots they are hatching, the surface is scratching
In the open corner where the news is late
In a netherland of foreign beads, in a netherland of foreign beads
In a netherland of foreign beads I'm gonna take you down, I'm gonna take the crown
I'm gonna take the crown, I'm gonna take the crown
A welcome to my friends
This house is a home and a home's where I belong
Where the feelings are warm and the foundations are strong
If my soul has a shape, well then it is an ellipse and this slap is a gift
'Cause your cheeks have lost their luster
You know your cheeks have lost their luster
You know your cheeks have lost their luster, luster, luster, luster
Take it back
Send return out of time
Tape machine needs to be aligned
Aloha means goodbye and also hello, it's in how you inflect
Put the bark in the dog and you've got a guardian
When the capital's S, it is followed by a T
And it's probably me
And the tones are grouped in clusters
You know the tones are grouped in clusters
Well, the tones are grouped in clusters
You know the tones are grouped in clusters, clusters, clusters, clusters
Take it back
Kiss me into the past
Lately never gonna last
Out beyond the call of duty, hold your instincts hostage and stick near me
Let's drink a toast, it's the most I can stand to cry about
The mental energy you wasted on this wedding invitation
Let's thank the host, you've been such a great host, the roast was just so perfectly prepared
Now I know you care
We are underused
Simply put, I want to grow old, dying does not meet my expectations
Let's drink a toast to all those who arrived alive to tell about their struggles in hushed tones around a fire
It's late winter, let's sink the ship, mix out blood, just the tip
A crip is sleeping on the basement stairs
Oh, I know he's there
We are underused
You know you've got it all wrong
There's no other way to find it
You know you've gotta be strong
And I really hope you plan to buy it
'Cause that's the way to Passat, babe
And that's the car to his soul
He will bring you all the millions in gold, child
If you will only let him have his role
Everybody wishes you'd gone
I've got no time to find it
And the dealer with the jingly song
Will never match my price reduction
'Cause that's the way to Passat, babe
And that's the car to his soul
He will bring you all the millions in gold
If you will only let him have his role
Yeah, you gotta be strong
There's no other way to find it
All the plantings are young and able
And I hope you find a way to buy it
'Cause that's the way to his heart, babe
And that's the way to his soul
You got to give him millions in gold, child
Before I go the way of the sold
And that's the way to his heart, babe
And that's the way to his soul
You got to give him millions in gold, child
Before I go the way of the sold
I heard what you said
The leaders are dead
They're robbing the skies
I can hear their followers cry
Starlings in the slipstream
The language of influence
Is cluttered with hard hard C's
And I put a spy-cam
In a sorority
Darlings on the split-screen
There's no women in Alaska
There's no Creoles in Vermont
There's no coast of Nebraska
My mother, I forgot
Slavic princess with a rose in her teeth, do you suppose she would bite you if she could?
Insane cobra split the wood, trader of the lowland breed
Call a jittney, drive away, in the slipstream we will stay
Stay away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away 
Open call for prison architects, send me your blueprints ASAP
Stack the walls such that I cannot breathe
Man is breeding forever, because of the weather
I hope soon to leave from the east
No more absolutes
No more absolutes
Stick your penitentiary clothes inside the vent
And run along, Leigh
Amateur sea salt gatherers colonized
They're good enough for Conrad Hilton, not good enough for my eyes
I trust you will tell me if I am making a fool of myself
Man is breeding forever, breeding forever
They come out and blister the sea
Deviances anticipated
Triple-X or at least R-rated
San Tropez, the middle of May
There's no tan lines tonight
No tan lines tonight,
But trench it, rev it
It's time to share spit
In the sauna, we'll become close
With ya, oh yeah!
Princess with a cold killer instinct
Winked at me from across the ice rink
Pleather uppers soft for the spins
But she gives it away without a rest
Language buried her in the motherland
Language barrier in the Pathan grain
Yeah, oh yeah!
You will be my candy striper
Junior Leaguer, bedpan wiper
Convalescent enema essence
I live to be gray, I live to be gray!
