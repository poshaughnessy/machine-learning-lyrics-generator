# Machine Learning test with textgenrnn

I thought I'd try out textgenrnn with Pavement lyrics.

## Instructions

```
pip3 install textgenrnn
pip3 install tensorflow
python3 run.py
```

## Example output

Here are some of the new lyrics that it's generated ðŸ˜†

```
I've got a protein for you
I've got a protein for you
I've got a protein for you
```

```
Silent kid, but they need to sleep, why don't you let me?
```

```
So it don't wait to say
And I'm bothery and it makes me feel okay
```

```
I've got a secret with the problem
I've got a secret for the shades of the problem
```

```
And one of the hold of her crime
The sharp and the city has a face
```

```
But the summer
On the riser is the halfword completely
Magical Push foreign time
```

```
I can see the shade of the complexity
I took the crown of the problem
```
